# Training-project

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of responses collected from participants of a Data Science Workshop. The analysis utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to systematically clean, transform, and visualize the dataset. Key steps include renaming columns for clarity, handling missing and inconsistent data, and converting data types for accurate analysis
